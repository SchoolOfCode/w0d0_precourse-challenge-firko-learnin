# freeCodeCamp Tribute Page
My tribute page is my *unnecessarily* long morning coffee routine.

Prior to making my page I already knew some basic HTML/CSS, some particularly useful points I learnt were:
* How to use semantic HTML to better separate sections on a page rather than solely relying on divs.
* New Emmet shortcuts in VS Code such as div.class which help speed up the workflow.
* How to use background-attachment to create different scrolling effects.
* Use of vw and vh to help maintain the structure of pages on different size browsers.
* The difference between padding, margins and borders.
